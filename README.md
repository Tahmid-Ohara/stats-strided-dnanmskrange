## Introduction

In statistics, the range of a dataset is a measure of dispersion, representing the difference between the maximum and minimum values. This project focuses on calculating the range for strided arrays, which are commonly used in performance-sensitive applications. The added complexity of handling NaN values and masks makes this tool especially useful for data analysis in JavaScript and Node.js environments.

### Key Features

- Calculate the range of strided arrays.
- Ignore NaN values in calculations.
- Support for masking to include or exclude specific elements.
- Built with performance in mind.

## Installation

To install the Stats Strided DNANMSKRange library, you can use npm:

```bash
npm install stats-strided-dnanmskrange
```

After installation, you can import it into your JavaScript or Node.js project:

```javascript
const { range } = require('stats-strided-dnanmskrange');
```

## Usage

Using the Stats Strided DNANMSKRange library is straightforward. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to use the `range` function:

```javascript
const { range } = require('stats-strided-dnanmskrange');

const array = new Float64Array([1.0, 2.0, NaN, 4.0, 5.0]);
const mask = new Uint8Array([1, 1, 0, 1, 1]); // Mask to include elements 0, 1, 3, 4

const result = range(array, mask);
console.log(result); // Output: { min: 1.0, max: 5.0, range: 4.0 }
```

## Examples

### Basic Range Calculation

```javascript
const { range } = require('stats-strided-dnanmskrange');

const data = new Float64Array([10.0, 20.0, 30.0, NaN, 50.0]);
const mask = new Uint8Array([1, 1, 1, 0, 1]);

const result = range(data, mask);
console.log(`Min: ${result.min}, Max: ${result.max}, Range: ${result.range}`);
// Output: Min: 10.0, Max: 50.0, Range: 40.0
```

### Handling All NaN Values

```javascript
const { range } = require('stats-strided-dnanmskrange');

const data = new Float64Array([NaN, NaN, NaN]);
const mask = new Uint8Array([1, 1, 1]);

const result = range(data, mask);
console.log(result); // Output: { min: NaN, max: NaN, range: NaN }
```

## API Reference

### `range(array, mask)`

Calculates the minimum, maximum, and range of a strided array while respecting a mask.

#### Parameters

- `array`: A `Float64Array` containing the data.
- `mask`: A `Uint8Array` that indicates which elements to include (1) or exclude (0).

#### Returns

An object containing:

- `min`: The minimum value in the array.
- `max`: The maximum value in the array.
- `range`: The difference between `max` and `min`.
